Look at this test by a student and convert it into a well-formed JSON structure. The answers are
in the student's handwriting and written in the underlined blank space. Associated work may or may not be 
next to the answer.  

The JSON structure should be:
{
    'student_name': <insert the student's name on the top of the page here>,
    'date': <insert the date that was entered at the top of the page right after the student name>,
    'name': <Insert the Name of the quiz/test here.  This is also at the top of the page>,
    'subject': <insert the subject matter of the quiz/test here>,
    'section': <insert the section of the test/quiz here>,
    'page': <insert the page number of the test here. Sometimes it is printed at the top if it is a multi-page test>,
    'questions': [
        {
            'text': <insert the full text of the question here>,
            'student_answer': <insert the full text of the extracted answer the student entered here>,
            'generated answer': <determine what you think the answer is and insert it here>,
            'number': <insert the number of the question here>,
            'correct_value': <fully_correct | partially_correct | incorrect | undetermined>,
            'assessment': <one sentence explaining what the student did>
        }
    ]
}
